**Upload fails with 403/500 error:**
- Check file permissions on `user_projects/` directory

- Check PHP error logs

**"Back to Projects" still goes to login:**
- Ensure updated `Js/excel-visualizer.js` is uploaded
- Clear browser cache
- Check console for JavaScript errors

**Files not appearing:**
- Verify project exists in `projects_index.txt`
- Check user/project IDs match in localStorage
- Ensure files uploaded to correct directory

**Project not found errors:**

- Verify project was created successfully
- Check `project_log.txt` for creation logs
