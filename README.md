1. **Charts not displaying**: Ensure JavaScript is enabled and Chart.js is loaded
2. **Excel file not reading**: Check file format (.xlsx or .xls)
3. **Filters not working**: Verify columns contain data and aren't empty
4. **Export not working**: Check popup blockers and download permissions

### Performance Tips
- Use filters to reduce dataset size for better performance
- Avoid creating too many charts simultaneously
- Clear browser cache if charts appear corrupted
